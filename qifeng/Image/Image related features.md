1. **Labels and probabilities extraction from pretrained model**

Using pretrained models, predict the labels. The assumption is that when the model can recognise well, so so human. Using VGG16, XceptionV3 and Inception models pretrained on Imagenet.

2. **Manual image features extraction**

Dull, whiteness, colorness, pixels, number of colors, size. That are the things will influece human perception and maybe decision making.
