We have 10 random KFold and constant difference between CV and LB near 0.005.

I'm more worried about this now., as we now know that the leaderboard is split by time with the public leaderboard
coming from April 12th and 13th, and the private leaderboard coming from April 14-18th. 
But we also know that deal_probability seems to be quite stable across time... 
if this is a time series problem, it's a very stationary one. So it's unclear to me if we need to do time series or not.
